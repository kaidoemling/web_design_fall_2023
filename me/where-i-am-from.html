            <p>While I was born in New Jersey, I grew up in <a href="https://www.saratoga.ca.us/"> Saratoga, California</a>, a part of Santa Clara county, a suburb of San Jose, and a town a part of Silicon Valley in the Bay Area. Saratoga is a mid-sized town with a population of 30,163. The downtown is pretty small, consisting of local coffee shops and restraunts. Saratoga is surrounded by mountains and forests, so spring time is especially rough for my allergies.</p>

            <p>Saratoga is a very peaceful town, but I definitely wanted to attend an out-of-state university as a change of scenery. Living in Saratoga felt like living in a bubble, so moving to New York City was a difficult adjustment at first, but I am very grateful for the opportunity to experience a different lifestyle from the one I am used to.</p>

            <h2>Bay Area/California</h2>

            <p>The Bay Area is home to beautiful nature, amazing food, and an abundance of culture. While there is not a lot for me to do in Saratoga, I love driving to and spending time in other local towns like Cupertino, Los Gatos, or San Jose. I usually hang out in these areas with either my friends or family to go shopping at the mall, go on a quick boba run, or thrift. I also often use the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) or the Caltrain to travel to further locations in the Bay. If I want to spend my day in San Francisco, I use the Caltrain, but if I want to visit my friend at her apartment in Berkeley, I use the BART.</p>

            <p>Some of my other favorite locations in California are Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara. Santa Cruz is about a 30 minute drive from my home, and is a great place to hang at the beach. This past summer, I visited my friend at UCSB in Santa Barbara. The drive there is around 5 hours, but the scenic route along the beach makes the drive worth it. </p>
